# Autism Prediction with Logistic Regression

This repository focuses on predicting the likelihood of having Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using Logistic Regression. The goal is to improve autism screening and assist healthcare professionals in prioritizing their resources.

## Abstract

Autism, or autism spectrum disorder (ASD), encompasses a range of conditions characterized by challenges in social skills, repetitive behaviors, and speech and nonverbal communication. This project aims to utilize machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of individuals having autism, thereby enhancing the diagnostic process and early intervention.

## About the Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of survey results from over 700 individuals who filled out an application form. The dataset includes labels indicating whether each person received a diagnosis of autism. By leveraging this dataset, machine learning models can be trained to predict the likelihood of autism in individuals, providing valuable insights for healthcare professionals.

## Causes and Challenges

Autism is predominantly influenced by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. It is a spectrum disorder, meaning that each individual with autism exhibits a unique set of strengths and challenges. The learning abilities, thinking patterns, and problem-solving skills of individuals with autism can vary greatly, ranging from highly skilled to severely challenged. Early intervention has been shown to significantly improve learning, communication, social skills, and brain development. However, the diagnostic process for autism can be time-consuming, often taking several years.

## The Role of Machine Learning

Machine learning techniques, particularly logistic regression, can play a crucial role in predicting the likelihood of autism based on survey data. By training models on the provided dataset, healthcare professionals can benefit from accurate predictions that help them allocate their resources effectively. Early identification and intervention can lead to better outcomes for individuals with autism, making this prediction task valuable in the field of healthcare.
